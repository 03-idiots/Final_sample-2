Title: "Exploit Public-Facing Application Vulnerabilities"
Date: October 25, 2024

Executive Summary:
Security researchers have identified a wave of attacks targeting vulnerabilities in Public-Facing Applications. Attackers use Command and Scripting Interpreter methods to automate the exploitation process. Following successful breaches, they employ Privilege Escalation Techniques to gain administrative access and utilize Process Injection techniques to run malicious code within legitimate processes.

Recommended Mitigations:

Regularly patch applications to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
Conduct security assessments to identify potential weaknesses in Public-Facing Applications.
Monitor for any unusual activity that could indicate Process Injection attempts.
